I thought this because if Aleph null is the smallest infinite list and it is the list of only integers, then wouldn't a list of only prime numbers be smaller? I read that all integers can be paired with all even Integers just by x paired with 2x, proving that they are lists of equal size, but I don't know if primes could match up that easily. Mainly because the list of all known prime numbers is finite(the highest recorded is  Mersenne prime M74207481) and prime numbers can't be evaluated into a series or a function in general. idk I was just curious as to your thoughts. thank you for your time.",1,true,1,,,,,,

There is one based on Mills' constant: f(n) = floor(Œ∏^3^n), where Œ∏ is the Mills' constant, a number approximately equal to 1.30637... (assuming the Riemann hypothesis is true, although the constant with the properties has been proven to exist regardless). Therefore, we can map integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... to f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5)... (which happen to be 2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, 16022236204009818131831320183...). This proves that this subset of prime numbers has the same cardinality as integers (aleph null), and therefore the set of all primes must have the same cardinality as well (if the prime cardinality was greater, there would be more primes than integers, which doesn't make any sense since the set of all primes is a subset of all integers, and if the prime set cardinality would be less, our subset of primes would have a greater cardinality than it, which also doesn't make any sense).",0

Sort the numbers in order like 9854 then in the other order like 4589
Now do 9854-4589 = 5265
Then do it again and again :
6552-2556 = 3986

To start things off, the easiest to understand: Mr. Krabs. He's the living definition of capitalism what with his money loving ways, low salary for both SpongeBob and Squidward and his daughter, Pearl, is the living symbol for capitalistic greed.

SpongeBob represents the Third Reich and their belief of the Aryan race: Blue eyes (white dragon) and Blond (yellow) hair. Spongebob, of course has both of these features and it is even better presented in one episode where he has golden flowing hair. Squidward represents upper class Europe with his fancy ways. He can also be interpreted as the Jews persecuted by the Germans which then helps clarify why SpongeBob constantly pesters him.

Up next is Plankton. Arch-nemesis of Mr. Krabs and this can be taken as enemy of capitalism as well. Who else despised capitalism? Soviet (Communist) Russia. Back then, Russia was thought to have this advanced society where everything is used and made with shiny silver/iron. This can be seen inside of the Chum Bucket operated by Plankton himself. Plankton constantly trying to steal Mr. Krabs' recipe is also a metaphor for Russia's attempts at sabotaging American society leading to the red scare that can be seen whenever Plankton is spotted within the Krusty Krab and the entire restaurant goes on lockdown to prevent anything from happening. 

Patrick represents the lower classes throughout war torn Europe. Patrick is unemployed and without education and conforms to whatever SpongeBob (Germany) does whether that be hunting and catching Jellyfish (outliers such as those that rebelled against Nazi Germany) or annoying Squidward (prosecuting the Jewish population).",0,false,0,,,,,,

For any positive integer N, in base N+1, taking any number with more than one digit, if you keep adding the digits together and subtracting that sum, then you will eventually end with N.  In other words, if you follow the same procedure in binary, you'll always end with a 1.  If you follow the same procedure in octal, you'll always end with a 7, etc.

The sketch of the proof is as follows: in base N+1 notation, if you subtract the sum of the digits from any positive whole number with more than one digit, then you will get a multiple of N.  Moreover, taking any multiple of N with more than one digit in base N+1, the sum of the digits is a strictly smaller but positive multiple of N.

So the basic idea goes like this.  You take your starting number, and subtract the sum of its digits.  You get a multiple of N.  Now, you add those digits together and subtract that, and you'll get a strictly smaller but nonzero multiple of N.  Continue this way if you still have a number with more than one digit.  Since there are only finitely many multiples of N smaller than any given multiple of N, this process must terminate.  Moreover, when it terminates, the result is strictly positive.  However, if you have more than one digit, then you can continue the process.  Thus, we see that this process must end with a positive single-digit number which is a multiple of N.  There is only one possibility here: N itself.",0

The trick is to see that after a certain point, the words used to represent a number will always have fewer letters than the value of the number itself.  It's pretty clear that this is true for numbers above twenty, for example.  Therefore, if you pick a big enough number, you will quickly find yourself having a small number of letters.

¬†Yes, roughly. Its original use was for deriving square roots in Babylon, China and India in ancient times. Heron systematized it into an algorithm step by step.
Newton and Rhapson did not generalize it. They accidentally derived the general case while working on Numerical analysis. They came up with a method to quickly converge on the solution of f(x) = 0, and putting f(x) = x^2-a, you get the square root of a. For that special case, the method is identical to the old Babylonian method.",0

The surface of the balloon is a terrible example, since the law states no holes in it. And since the balloon's hollow inside, you should think about it this way: imagine our OBSERVABLE (!!!) universe is the air in the balloon. This way if you keep blowing the balloon, herewith expand it. There will be a point in the balloon (our observable universe) which hasn't moved. There's plenty of things we don't know about our universe, yet there's a lot which we know about our OBSERVABLE universe. We DO know it's bounded (the diameter is exactly the years passed since the big bang happend, but in lightyears), and since it's expanding there's no hole on it.

EDIT: I've been rethinking this topic over again, and i made a theorical mistake. The observable universe does expand as the air in the ballon, as more and more light reaches earth as time passes by (so we can see ""further""), but i was neglecting the fact, that the whole universe is expanding as the surface of the balloon, which makes my hypothesis invalid.",3

Clearly, two  antipodal points that have no connection other than the same body as one another wouldn't necessarily have to have anything to do with one another.

And I think this is where we get into problems with continuous numbers, because you can come up with a million absurd statements similar where, if you assume that distance, time, temperature, and the like are thought of as continuous curves.

You don't even need antipodal points.  You can say that two points within your house must be exactly the same temperature and pressure as one another as well.  

This is why each measurement should be seen as its own individual reading with a certain margin of error attached.  Graphing such measurements can give useful information about cause, effect or correlation if nothing else, but once you start applying functional curves to reality, that's when you run into absurdity.",0,false,0,,,,,,

And he already noted that the finite number of atoms in the coffee mug does effect the capability of fixed points, but that is simply because the atom is too large of a size, so do note that you can always measure... a part of an atom, and a part of an atom can suddenly end up the same place with better precision than a whole atom, if it doesn't, well, we can always go... deeper, infinitely deeper, until we find a size describing a portion of an atom, that will end up back in the same place in a closed enviroment.

Then turn the table 90¬∞, while letting the same three legs glued to the floor.¬†The fourth leg is now at a negative altitude (obviously that's just a thought experiment).

If you think it through, when things said ""lighter-than-air"" are ascending upwards it's not because they are beating gravity, but because they are floating (ie. less dense than the air around). Flotation and Buoyancy are the same phenomenon, but one is in air and the other is in water.

I have heared that you have prepeared a show together with Adam Savage. Now I presume preparing a show takes a lot of energy and time. Now my asumtion is that this may be the reason for your decreasing frequency of uploading content on this particular channel.
What I want to say is that I am a bit sad that I sometimes have to wait two months for a new video of yours. I know it tajes ablot of time and effort to create content like you do. But you also let go on viewer interaction. I myself would be happy to kow the reason as far as you think it is apropriate to tell your community. This is meant to be a feedback (also criticism), I know you don't have to do what your community wants you to do. I just hope to recieve an answer on why you are publishing fewer videos. Maybe it is not as fun as it used to be? (I hope not)

Instantaneous, or instant, mind you, is not a noun, it is a verb. A descriptive state of being, and a non quantifiable length in time. Even using quantum mechanics, as the definition of something moving instantly from here, to there, it would be different than quantum entanglement, as the object only occupies one space in spacetime, but it would move far beyond the speed of light if say an object moved instantly from the Milky Way Galaxy to the Andromeda Galaxy.

2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 disks dough for Basic Crust 
1 large egg, beaten
Coarse sugar, for sprinkling

Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and salt; cook until thickened, 1 more minute. Let cool.

Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface; ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the apples, mounding them slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay it over the filling; press the edges of the crusts together, then fold the overhang under itself and crimp to seal. Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Chill 1 hour.

Place a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Cool on a rack",0,false,0,,,,,,

It sounds like total bullshit to me. Take for example Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. People often believe that Dart Vader says ""Luke, I am your father"". I thought it was ""No, Luke, I am your father"" because I distinctly remembered there being no. But apparently a lot of others thought it was just ""Luke, I am your father"". To me it just seems kind of obvious. I've heard that moment quoted so many times by Star Wars fans and in pop-culture that the Luke part infiltrated my memory. Also, maybe it's just a common mistake because Luke's the subject being spoken to... 

Some references which I found on a Star Wars fan site:

Austin Powers 

Austin Powers (Mike Myers) shoots the running Dr. Evil in his spacesuit. He turns to Austin and says (with a voice similar to Vader's): ""But, before you kill me... know this... Austin... I am your father"".

Speed Racer: The Next Generation

When Connor says that it's a coincidence that Speed has Speed Racer's things and implies that he might be a relative, Speed replies, ""I have as much of a chance of being related to Speed Racer as you do of being a relative of Darth Vader."" Robot Chim-Chim puts a bucket on Connor's head and Connor immitates Darth Vader's breathing and says, ""Speed, I am your father.

Tommy Boy (1995) 

‚ÄùAt one point Tommy (Chris Farley) says, ""Luke, I am your father"" into a fan, which makes his voice sound mechanical.‚Äù

Toy Story 2

Later in the movie, Buzz Lightyear II accuses Emperor Zurg of killing his father. Then, Zurg reveals that he is Buzz's father: ""No, Buzz, I am your father,"" as Buzz screams ""Noooooo!"" while descending down the elevator. By the end of the film, they're playing together and experiencing lots of good father-son bonding.
I would have to agree with swagmaster, nobody has perfect memory. I saw the movie once or twice as a child... and again in my teens. Nobody can remember the dialogue of a movie verbatim. When we do not specifically recite or purposely commit something like that to memory, our memory can be infiltrated like that, especially when it's been years since you've watched the movie. It doesn't affect the context of the situation anyway.",0

So what you said is obviously true. BUT when you scale down the whole board to be smaller then a square,it becomes very possible.
so take your really small board and place it in the bottom right corner, say its gray. Obviously you'll have the gray square of the small board that glows. but then here's what you do. flip the board 180 degrees and place it so that your small little gray square (that is now on the top left of your small board) and the whole vertical line it is in right outside the big gray square, like, right against it.
So what you end up is, the small checkerboard overlapping two big squares. lets say the other big square is yellow. well basically, the small checkerboard will be mostly on a big gray square, but the actual little gray square and the column he is in will be on the big yellow square.
but what about the small yellow square, where is he at? well if you do this and make it so that the little gray square is right against the big gray square, you'll find that the small yellow square is on the big gray square, right against the big yellow square. If you do this just right  nothing will glow and no rules have been broken.

Now this is very hard to explain verbally, as you can see, But i am pretty positive that what i'm saying is true.

But how do you explain this because Micheal obviously said that whatever you do, one point of the checkerboard will, no matter what, stay right where it began right ?

Well turns out this stays true. its just that the checkerboard is not such a great example at the end of the day. Because the point that has not moved in the scenario I created right above, is a point that is perfectly on the line between the yellow and the gray squares.

now if you did not understand what i tried to explain, its okay. Again, its very hard to explain something visual in just a YouTube comment. 

(sorry for the spelling errors and such, i'm not a native English speaker..)

All that said, if you read until this point, have a great day!

That statement made in the video (9:38) is, in fact, almost always FALSE.

Here's why:
While it is demonstrably true that at least one pair of points diametrically opposed on Earth's surface (antipodes) must have the same temperature, and it is demonstrably true that at least one pair of antipodes must have the same atmospheric pressure... what is not demonstrably true is that the antipodes that have the same temperature also has the same atmospheric pressure, or vice versa.  Atmospheric pressure and temperature are NOT functionally dependent upon one another.

What is true is:
There are always two antipodes where temperature are the same, and there are always two antipodes where pressure are the same, but they are not necessarily the same pair of antipodes.... the statement in the video was that there is always a pair of antipodes where temperature AND pressure are the same.",0,true,1,,,,,,

You take two thermometers and measure the temperature at two points on exact opposite sides of the earth, then switch their places while keeping them on opposite sides of the earth from each other and graph the temperatures they both record. You'd find that no matter how you move them across the earth to switch their locations (of course except that both thermometers must be on opposite sides of the planet), the graph of their temperatures must intersect somewhere. So you'd find that at all times there is not just one pair of points, but an entire line going around the earth where the temperature is the same on both sides of the earth (the line at 12:08). 
Then, take two barometers and place them at two antipodes that are on that line and switch their locations and make a graph of the air pressures they record. At some point, the two lines on the pressure graph would intersect just as the two lines on the temperature graph did. Thus, on the line of all antipodes where temperature is the same, one pair of them has the same air pressure as well.",9

I love this video so much, and i would love it if everyone were able to learn from what you have to say in the video.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of auto-generated subtitles, there are quite a few errors in the captioning that make it very difficult for the hearing impaired to enjoy your video.  For instance, at 0:12 into the video, the captions say ""hey Vsauce Michael here there is an art museum on the move"" when it should say ""Hey Vsauce, Michael here.  There is an art museum on the moon.""  As you can see, this would make it difficult for someone who is hearing impaired to understand what you are saying.  There are many occurrences like this throughout the video, especially when you give the names of some of the scientists such as when you say ""Fred Waldhauer"" the captions say ""friend Walt hour.""   Could you fix the captions when you get the chance to?  It would really help the 360 million people globally who rely on closed captions to understand videos.

   I figured you would be answer to this question for me. 

  If the earth was neutron and the sun was an electron, would the same physics apply as we experience them now. And what I mean by that, will time pass at the same rate. Or as time is merely an illusion will it seem to pass faster. Also will light travel at the same rate? I know all you others here, dont jump on me yet. But if you were to live on an atom an you had a laser pointed an another atom, will that light travel to you as a person now, at the same rate. I know really confusing but just a thought. However as we look at quantum entanglement and sting theory, I am coming more and more closer to think that not the same physics will not apply.",0,false,0,,,,,,

No, elevation is not continuous.  There are jumps in elevation between certain points.  For instance, look at the walls of the Grand Canyon.  Sure, some parts are sloped, but other parts of large drop-offs, making elevation discontinuous.

But even if elevation were discontinuous, the fact that there is only one ""highest point on Earth"" would not invalidate the theorem just as much as there being only one ""hottest place on Earth"" doesn't invalidate the theorem.

The theorem makes no claim about what the temperature at those two antipodal points (which have the same temperature) is.  It never says that there are two antipodal points which are also the hottest point on Earth.  It just says that those two points have the same temperature.  Similarly, if I were to say that there are two antipodal points on Earth which have the same elevation, that would not imply that those two points are the highest points on Earth.",0

Example:

42
Forty Two (Five letters, Three letters)
5 + 3 = 8
Eight (Five letters)
5 
Five (Four letters)
4
Four (Four letters)

Example 2:

1,962 
One thousand nine hundred sixty two (Thirty letters)
30
Thirty (Six letters)
6 
Six (Three letters)
3
Three (Five letters)
5
Five (Four letters)
4
Four (Four letters)

Heck, it doesn't even have to start with a number. 

Deoxyribonucleic Acid (Twenty letters)
20
Twenty (Six letters)
6 
Six (Three letters)
3
Three (Five letters)
5
Five (Four letters)
4
Four (Four letters)

It can even be ridiculously stupid:

A (One letter)
1
One (Three letters)
3 
Three (Five letters)
5
Five (Four letters)
4
Four (Four letters).

There is no escaping it. If you count the numbers, it always goes back to 9, and if you count the words, it always goes back to 4. Want to know the scary part? In some cultures, the number 4 is believed to represent the end of life. And in German, the word for ""no"" is ""nein,"" which is pronounced exactly like ""nine.""",0,false,0,,,,,,

Here is my source on 97%, with link:
Anderegg, William R L; Prall, James W.; Harold, Jacob; Schneider, Stephen H. (2010). ""Expert credibility in climate change"". Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107 (27): 12107‚Äì9.

So, let's stop talking about the credibility of my ""contrived"" number ‚Äî that's not the point. It does not do well to accuse a statistic of being false when a 2-minute search can identify the study it comes from. More importantly, I must ask; are you a climate change denier due to wilful ignorance? Because if you are, this is not worth my time.",0

Here are several dubious (painfully unscientific) sources for your beloved '97%' figure:

1.  One frequently cited source for the consensus is a 2004 opinion essay published in Science magazine by Naomi Oreskes, a science historian. She claimed to have examined abstracts of 928 articles published in scientific journals between 1993 & 2003, and found that 75% supported the view that human activities are responsible for most of the observed warming over the previous 50 years while none directly dissented.  Ms. Oreskes's definition of consensus covered ""man-made"" but left out ""dangerous"".  Scores of articles by prominent scientists such as Richard Lindzen, John Christy, Sherwood Idso and Patrick Michaels, who question the consensus, were excluded (!) 

2.  Another widely cited source for the consensus view is a 2009 article in ""Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union"" by Maggie Kendall Zimmerman, a student at the University of Illinois and her master's thesis adviser Peter Doran. It reported the results of a two-question online survey of selected scientists. Mr. Doran & Ms. Zimmerman claimed ""97 percent of climate scientists agree"" that global temperatures have risen and that humans are a significant contributing factor. The survey's questions don't reveal much of interest. Most scientists who are skeptical of catastrophic global warming nevertheless would answer ""yes"" to both questions. The survey was silent on whether the human impact is large enough to constitute a problem. Nor did it include solar scientists, space scientists, etc.  The ""97%"" figure in the Zimmerman/Doran survey represents the views of only 79 respondents who listed climate science as an area of expertise and said they published more than half of their recent peer-reviewed papers on climate change. Seventy-nine scientists‚Äîof the 3,146 (!) who responded to the survey‚Äîdoes not a consensus make.""

(You cite:) 

3. In 2010, William R. Love Anderegg, then a student at Stanford University, used Google Scholar to identify the views of the most prolific writers on climate change.  His findings were published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences. Mr. Anderegg found that 97% to 98% of the 200 most prolific writers on climate change believe ""anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for 'most' of the 'unequivocal' warming."" There was no mention of how dangerous this climate change might be; and, of course, 200 researchers out of the thousands who have contributed to the climate science debate is not evidence of consensus.

4. In 2013, John Cook, an Australia-based blogger, and some of his friends reviewed abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published from 1991 to 2011. Mr. Cook reported that 97% of those who stated a position explicitly or implicitly suggest that human activity is responsible for some warming. His findings were published in Environmental Research Letters.  Mr. Cook's work was quickly debunked...."" 

Summary:

""Of the various petitions on global warming circulated for signatures by scientists, the one by the Petition Project, a group of physicists and physical chemists based in La Jolla, Calif., has by far the most signatures‚Äîmore than 31,000 (more than 9,000 with a Ph.D.). It was most recently published in 2009, and most signers were added or reaffirmed since 2007. The petition states that ""there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of . . . carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.""

We could go on, but the larger point is plain. There is no basis for the claim that 97% of scientists believe that man-made climate change is a dangerous problem.""",0

I can tell this is either because of willful ignorance or just someone baiting someone else ‚Äî you contradict yourself. You first said you don't believe in AGW. But what you've said (or copy-pasted straight from the Wall Street Journal, obviously the most reliable scientific journal /s) in the above comment states that AGW is real and agreed upon by the vast majority of scientists (just not whether it is dangerous, which was not explicit in the studies but is not contradicted by them).

Also, I must say that the petition you provided only helps the case that almost every scientist believes in global warming. 30,000 people with any degree in ""Atmosphere, Earth, and Environment fields, Computers and Math, Physics and Aerospace, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, and Agriculture, Medicine, General Engineering and General Science"" say they agree with the petition.

I'm not suggesting that number is accurate, but it's certainly not saying that many scientists think global warming is a myth.

If anything, all your sources agreed that 97% of scientists say anthropogenic global warming exists. All that's in debate is whether or not this is dangerous, which was admittedly not mentioned (but not contradicted) by the studies.
But that's not what you're trying to say. You're saying AGW is a myth. That goes against what your sources say. Nothing you mentioned above stated that less than 97% of scientists agree AGW exists. If you don't believe me, read them again. And next time, use a proper scientific journal and not the Wall Street Journal for your science.",0

These are 'problems' that you might be able to 'fix'. You can establish your own stats regarding their gravity and develop your own solutions and so on.

¬†Just ignore the pixel example. It was a bad example.
¬†With pixels, it is possible to break the definition. With a continuous shape of an indefinite number of points (inside the shape), it is not. This is because the pixel sheet has a defined number of points.

¬†As such, there is no issue with the idea/theorem/what-have-you.

If you assign a color to each point in a continuous square then no continuous transformation that remains in the square can send every point to one of a different color. Borders (sets of points that are not contained in a circle of finite radius all of which are solidly that color) must exist, and you have not defined what it means to ""align"" them. You cannot get rid of them.
The only way to ""break"" the theorem is to apply it to a context it is not designed for. If you are seriously going to argue that the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is false then you can send your counter-example to a university, become famous, and leave mathematicians going mad trying to find the errors in the proof (as a bonus you can point the error out to them).

z12nvjdznxycfzmob04ci3sijoicfzfj2io,Ayy Lmao,7 months ago,1476525168835,"Vsause is wrong here, you CAN have earth not have at least two antipodal points on the earth where a the atmospheric pressure and temperature is different, well, In fact, I don't think there ever will, or has been one point that is exactly the same, well at least not until the heat death of the universe.

tldr; Temperature jumps from atom to atom, ALWAYS, so there will ALWAYS be JUMPS in the graph he showed, meaning it won't pass through each other when it flips, it will JUMP PAST each other.

To explain why he's wrong. Lets look at temperature, the fact that the temperate EVER changes anywhere on earth proves that there was a jump in temperature. If it is 1 degrees on point A and 2 on point B, then somewhere, between point A and B, there was a jump in temperature, unless point A and B are an INFINITE distance away, which is not the case when it comes to earth. The only way for a continues string of variables along a sphere to be perfectly containing of every single inbetween temperature of 1 and 2 is for either for every point on the sphere to be the same temperature already, or for the sphere to be infinitely large. 


As you may have seen him explain on his ""how to count past infinity"" video, there are Infinite digits between 1 and 2, therefore Infinite possible temperatures, there fore on earth there is always a point where when temperature changes, there is a jump in temperature change. A JUMP, not a incline, there fore the two points you flipped can JUMP at any point and will technically jump at EVERY SINGLE point. 


The same is for atmospheric pressure, there will always be JUMPS in pressure, making his little explanation wrong. 


If it were a sphere with infinite locations in a theoretical world, maybe. but on earth, it's just 100% incorrect to make that assumption.


Now someone might go ahead and say """"There are infinite points, which are infinitely small, between point A and point B, therefore it could change at a rate instead of jumps"""", which is wrong, because temperature varies ATOM to ATOM, and JUMPS ATOM to ATOM, so, in this universe. Vsause is incorrect. Temperature JUMPS atom to atom, not changes like his little chart showed.",2,true,4,,,,,,

z12ycvq4mqvlt5psd22xyt1xqnzwtriwr04,Alexander Demetrius,7 months ago,1476525170587,"Hello, for no reason in particular I wanted to ask anyone who is good at probability and numbers to disprove my logic stating that ""infinite"" is impossible. I just wanted someone to disprove this because I think a lot, keep getting stuck on this point and no one seems to want to listen to me.

Infinite has an intrinsic probability. For example if a light has two settings (on, off) that means there is a 1 in 2 chance it is on and 1 in 2 chance it is off. 0.5 probability. If there are two lights with two settings there are one in four chances the first will be on and the second off. 0.25 probability. If there are infinite lights and infinite settings that means there is a 1 over 1 chance they are all on. 1 probability. This doesn't seem to make sense as there is 100% chance they are both all on and all off. You could also say it like this. If there are infinite universes there is 100% chance there is one that you can travel to all universes from and 100% chance there is a universe that cannot be traveled to even though they cannot logically coexist. 

Now intelligent people and people who think they are intelligent have I found something, have done something illogical in my reasoning or is there some science/mathematics that has already taken this into account. Bear in mind I have not yet completed high school and feel free to just use this as a debate section as well if you do respond. Thank you. :D",0,false,0,,,,,,

z13uxfngzuqle323z23thj35pufahrhco,Kisama,7 months ago,1476525183258,"Bah. That theorum(in regards to Earth) assumes that you can't go from one point to another without the temperature/pressure raising/dropping in spikes. In other words: the temperature in point A and the temperature in point B drops 2 degrees, not 1. If you use exact points on the graph, instead of line, then no, this theory just falls apart. In fact, the further your degree of accuracy goes, the more unlikely it is that you will ever see two opposite points on earth with the same temperature, or the same pressure.

This theory for Earth only holds if you graph using a straight line instead of pinpoint accuracy. 
Example: Point A was 13.659 degrees on both sides of the Earth, but no matter what, there was no Point B that was 13.659c, 13.658c, or 13.660c, simply because the temperature of the very next atom nearby on at least one side was 13.661c, while the other side was 13.657c. 
Or, the very next atom was .000000000000000000001m to the left/right/up/down of it's counterpart. 
Or, there was no atom at all to counterpoint, just the vacuum between loosely packed atoms, which is more likely if the surface is water. 

The theory for the coffee cup is also misleading: there are infinitely more places for atoms of coffee to exist than there are atoms in the cup. Even by a degree of movement as small as the fraction of a fraction of an electron's quark, the chance that EVERY ATOM will be somewhere new and not occupying any previously existing place EXACTLY (the most exact atom could still be 1 degree tilted on the z axis differently than before mixing) is infinitesimal. 

The theory CAN be true for these examples, simply due to probability, or by looseness of definition. But the more exact you make your definitions, the less likely it will occur, if ever.",0,false,0,,,,,,

We already have a variable for infinity (the aforementioned sideways 8), which you can't do anything with because it's infinite.

If you move through space very quickly, or are under the influence of extreme gravitational forces you will seemingly experience time at a slower rate than someone who is not. In your own individual frames of reference you wouldn't notice anything unusual, and would both say that time is behaving normally. But if you slowed down and returned to this person your clock would say that less time has passed than your theirs would. 

This occurs because the speed of light is fixed, and all observers must agree on it despite discrepancies within their reference frames. In other words: General relativity is confusing and I'm not nearly a good enough mathematician to test the equations myself so I just accept it as true because it has been proven as such.",0

1. Take any 4 digit number that isn't just 4 identical numbers (for example, 9999 won't work). Let's use 8593.
2. Reorder the numbers from largest to smallest - 9853.
3. Reorder the numbers from smallest to largest - 3589.
4. Subtract the number in step 3 from the number in step 2. 9853-3589 = 6264
5. Repeat steps 2-4 with the same number and record the result:
5a.  6642-2466 = 4176
5b.  7641-1467 = 6174
5c.  7641-1467 = 6174

You'll notice that no matter which 4 digits you choose, as long as they're not all the same digit, you'll eventually reach 6174 and it will keep looping forever. This is Kaprekar's constant.

If you filled a balloon squeezed stretched and shook it those would all be continuous functions providing you don't let the balloon touch it's self on the inside.

1 photon with
3 components  (Electrical, Magnetic, Direction) all basically 90 degrees from each other,
each component having an oscillation of energy,
maximum in one direction, neutral, maximum in the other direction.

So:
Electrical : max in one direction, neutral, max in the other direction;
Magnetic : max in one direction, neutral, max in the other direction;
Direction  : max in one direction, neutral, max in the other direction.
(The direction of a stationary photon is a pulse.  It goes to it's central core area, then flips and goes to it's max extension area, then flips, etc, etc, etc);

6 maximum most reactive positions with
9 total reactive positions (neutrals included).
Hence 1, 3, 6, 9 being very prominent numbers in our math systems.

You're still causing a translation of the coffee, you can think of it like you're still causing it to rotate/spin, only instead of rotating around an axis that goes through the center of the coffee (as you do by traditional stirring), you're now just rotating along an axis that goes horizontally through the coffee mug. And if you're just pulling molecules up from the bottom, well that's equivalent to starting your spoon at one antipode and moving it to the opposite antipode, only instead of along the X or Z axis you're now using the Y axis. As long as all of the molecules of the coffee mug start and end within the confines of the mug, then you have got a fixed point at which at least one molecule is in the same, within a certain degree of accuracy, position as when it started.",3

Mixing coffee is not a continuous transformation because coffee itself, being made of molecules, is technically not a continuous medium. Brouwer's theorem applies only to continuous medium. You could actually think about ""rearranging"" all the molecules in your coffee, one by one, so that the ""first"" one goes in ""second"" place, the ""second"" one in ""third"" place, and so on, with any order that you arbitrarily chose. However, if you randomly choose, in an urn full of all molecules, which one will take the first spot, then which one takes the second spot, and so on, these very particular ""nothing matching"" arrangements are way less probable than arrangements in which no single molecule is in its initial place, which you can see as a discrete representation of entropy, if you like.
In the real-case scenario, choose a very small, tiny distance d (I would say less than the average distance between two molecules in your coffee), and comparing two snapshots of your coffee at any two moments, you will find at least one molecule whose position on snapshot 2 is at a distance less than d from its position on snapshot 1. But it's actually more of a statistical result, even though Brouwer himself got the idea while stirring his coffee.",12

It's more likely you get stuck there because the numbers around it create a funnel that always leads to 4. Three (5) -> Five (4) -> Four (4), or Six (3) -> Three (5) -> Five (4)  -> Four (4). I tried this out with Spanish and it doesn't work, because the numbers surrounding it's only number Cinco (5) are Cuatro (6) and Seis (4). So if you take Veintidos (9) -> Nueve (5) -> Cinco (5) it works. But if you use Veintitres (10) -> Diez (4) -> Cuatro (6) -> Seis (4) -> Cuatro (6) -> Seis (4), you get stuck in an endless loop and never land on Cinco.

Ordinals are basically a generalisation natural numbers, usually defined as an equivalence class (or representative of an equivalence class) of well ordered sets. A well ordered set is any totally ordered set (basically something ordered the way you would expect) with the additional property that every non empty subset contains a least element (that is, if you select arbitrarily many arbitrary elements you can find one of them that is the smallest). The integers with the usual <= are not an ordinal, since the negative numbers, for example, do not contain a smallest element. However, there exists a well ordering of the integers, for example 0 1 2 3 .... -1 -2 -3 -4 ... in which case aleph -1 would be huge.",0

When I get older I want to get bald, have that exact beard and wear those exact glasses. If I had to choose my favorite person in human history, excluding ineligibles like Jesus and the Apostles, and Neil Peart (because I'm sure Jesus was human, Neil Peart... not so much), that person would definetly be Michael's dad who had the power to seed and raise such an amazing person.

Now seriously, I'm not much of a fan-boy. I wouldn't get hyper in the presence of any ""celebrity"", not even Stephen Hawking or freaking Neil Peart himself, but I would behave very poorly if Michael was before me. No homo, of course, but everything else is on the table. I would probably ask him to wear his glasses, have pictures taken with me over his shoulders. have videos directed by him parodying his act.

However the coffee mixing is not entirely accurate, I think. Actually coffee is a liquid, which means that it can be transformed in a non continuous way, molecules in the coffee are free to move away from each other allowing other molecules to fill up the space. If you imagine a connected ball of coffee initially inside the coffee filled mug, you can split it with a spoon and put one half away from the other, resulting in your transformation function having a non connected image of a connected set, thus the function is not continuous and the fixed point theorem doesn't apply.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Your statement about mixing coffee is incorrect. Once you put the object inside of the coffee you have changed its bounds (the coffee is displaced up the cup) and created a hole where the spoon is filling. Then you also have to consider as a liquid you can by mixing the coffee ""cut and glue"" the component molecule to new ones as you mix it around as they are all similarly attracted to each other. This is how the coffee can flow around the spoon.
If your statement held true for mixing liquids then fluid mechanics would be a lot similar than it is.",1,false,0,,,,,,

With liquids you of course have a couple billion times more atoms to consider, so higher chance due to that, but you also have a vastly bigger possibility realm.

This video is so riddled with errors I hardly know where to begin.
Let me take the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.  In order for it to be true, both temperature and pressure must vary continuously over the surface of the earth, but neither do.  Regions of different temperatures and pressures are separated by boundary layers that meteorologists call fronts.  Since the assumptions of the theorem are violated, the application of the theorem is invalid.
I knew you were going to hit one of my pet peeves the moment you mentioned infinity.  Aleph Null is not a number.  No operations valid for numbers are defined for it, not even equality.  Furthermore, any infinite sequence at n terms is different from the infinite sequence less one term at n terms by the difference between the first and nth terms, for any and all n, so they are only equal when the first and nth are equal.  In a monotonically decreasing sequence, this is never true. So Aleph subscript infinite aleph is not equal to Aleph subscript [infinite less one|warning: this expression is undefined, too] aleph for both reasons.
The coffee stirring example is wrong for the same reason as the Borsuk-Ulam example, coffee is not continuous.  I give you credit for noting that coffee isn't continuous, but a collection of particles.  But I give you failing marks for continuing.  A theorem which isn't true for discontinuities isn't true.  There is no such thing in logic as almost true.
But for the sake of argument, let's pretend coffee is a continuous substance.  Putting the spoon in it is a discontinuous deformation.  So is taking the spoon out.  If some of the coffee sticks to the spoon when you take it out, its a cut.  If a drop of that liquid falls off the spoon back into the coffee, that's a paste.  And let's not forget the water vapor that escaped while you were stirring.",0,false,0,,,,,,

The idea of the theorm is that if time is frozen (although same approach could in theory be done if tested while moving around Earth at fastest speeds to make temperature and pressure changes impossible to do), then no changes can take place that damage this idea while the test proceeds. How it works is as you move the thermometer around the Earth at some point the temperatures must change to reflect each other, if so there is a point where they were both the same. Then the same is applied for the crossing area of all those points (logic dictates a ring should be made around the Earth of all points) with pressure, and basically its guaranteed that there will always be a point where this is true on Earth.",0

You start at thermometer A (let's say it has 20 degrees) and travel around the earth until you get to thermometer B (10 degrees). 

The key here is taht while you are travelling there is always a point directly opposite you on the other side of the earth (a.k.a your antipode).

While you are travelling your temperature reading will start at 20 degrees and eventually get to 10 degrees when you reach thermometer B.

While you are travelling the point opposite you will start at 10 degrees and eventually get to 20 degrees when it reaches thermometer A.

Your temperature reading starts off being greater than your antipode's temperature reading right? But at some point your temperature reading will eventually be less than your antipode's temperature reading, because your final reading is 10 degrees (when you reach thermometer B) and your antipode's final temperature reading will be 20 degrees (when it reaches thermometer B). 

Right before that point in time when your temperature is less than your antipode's temperature is when you have exactly the same temperature reading as your antipode. 

Idk if I've just confused you more, but whatever.

Thermometer (B) could read 10 degrees and while you're moving the thermometer (B) to a place that is 8 degrees, it will pass 9 degrees, and the opposite thermometer (A) also reads 9 degrees as that place actually is 9 degrees, but the place that thermometer (B) is, isn't 9 degrees, its 8 degrees.

""But that doesn't mean the places the thermometers are at the time of that reading (The very middle of the X) are the same.""

This theorem says nothing about the thermometers being in the same position, rather the thermometers are always at antipodal positions. The X in that graph represents the point at which their temperatures are the same, not their locations. It's a graph of temperature over time, not location over time.

Also, just a side note, if B passes 9 degrees, it has to at some point have a reading of 9 degrees, because it is moving continuously.",0

He is trying to break the YouTube video's policy.

This seems true only in the case that an isotherm or isobar happens to have precisely corresponding antipodes to itself, allowing the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem to be used again. I do not see how math would prove this true with two continuous variables considered independently the way you described. It could just be a rare coincidence. However with that argument, it then seems highly unlikely, and can be conceivably false. I watched the other videos on the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem from the links in the dooblydoo of your video and I am still not convinced of the proof method described. However, if elevation change is possible, then any path can be isobaric by changing the elevation. There can then be a forced set of isobaric antipodes to work with, and the statement becomes true. Still, it is difficult to technically discuss temperature and pressure separately because they are related by the ideal gas law.",0,true,1,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,default-z12wuzmpmzujd3auv223w5pxwt3ljlu5j04.1475127974880985,EnteiFire4,7 months ago,1476525438981,"Take f(x) = T(x) - T(-x), where T(y) is the temperature at the point y and -y is the antipode of the point y. Of course, f is continuous.

Take ANY starting point a, and take ANY path from a to -a and apply f to every point in that path.

If T(a) = T(-a), then we've found our antipodes with the same temperature! Cool!
If T(a) < T(-a), then f(a) < 0 and f(-a) > 0.
If T(a) > T(-a), then f(a) > 0 and f(-a) < 0.

According to the intermediate value theorem, we conclude that there is a point c of the path where f(c) = 0 and therefore T(c) = T(-c).

As the video explains, since ANY path has that point c, we conclude that there is a line of points that goes around the Earth where the antipodes have the same temperature. However, it doesn't mean that all those points have the exact same temperature! The proof for the pressure is the same as above, using the specific path where the antipodes have the same temperature.",0

What the F does this even mean. 

V sauce is your channel, your audience is not named V Sauce. You do not hear George Stephanopolous say ""Heyyyy ABC news, George here"" 
ABC news knows who he is, there is no need to introduce himself to the station. He can introduce himself to the audience though if he wishes, that is acceptable. 
""Good evening this is George and you are watching ABC news"" is correct

Your name is not ""V sauce michael"" so ""Heyyy (Vsauce Michael) here"" is not what you were intending so we know that is incorrect

""Hey this is Michael with V-Sauce"" is acceptable
""Hey this is V-Sauce and I am your host Michael"" acceptable

The lunar surface is more reflective than most regions on earth. So stars can't particularly be seen unless you took the time to look up and allow your eyes to adjust. That's how you're able to see the north star in the morning. You look up at the sky at a part of the sky that is away from the sun, and you let your eyes adjust until you can see it. When they were in shadow, the astronauts have stated they were able to see stars, but they didn't take photos when they were in shadow, because...it'd be dark. Makes sense, right?

If they happened to care, they could have pointed their camera at the sky, adjusted the aperture nice and small and take a nice long exposure, and they could've taken wonderful photographs of stars.

There really isn't very much dust at all in the earth's atmosphere. And moisture, when in the form of humidity (as opposed to clouds) does nothing to reduce light levels. Not that it matters. My point, to repeat, was you can see the north star if and only if you purposefully try to see the north star. If the astronauts purposefully tried to photograph the north star on the moon, they could have. But they didn't, because the north star is pretty uninteresting compared to the moon when you are right there on its surface, and your mission is to collect information about the moon.",0

I already addressed your shadows. There ARE multiple light sources on the moon. 1: there's the sun. 2: There's the sunlight reflected from all the moondust around you. 3: there's the sunlight reflected from the great big white lunar-lander. That 3rd one is what caused the second shadow. On earth, in outdoor photography, we use reflectors, literally big white boards that an intern holds, all the time to serve as a fill light. This is the same exact situation.
And again: If they were on a film set trying to look like the moon, WHY OH WHY would they be so dumb as to turn on a 2nd light?!? Do you think it is hard to only have one light on when on a sound-stage? Of course not!",0

¬†Regarding your sun at dawn: On earth, when the sun is low, it becomes dimmer because the light passes through a greater amount of atmosphere. This is amplified in the winter months because of the earth's tilt. On the moon, because there is no atmosphere, you have neither of those effects. As long as the sun is all the way up in the sky, it's the same brightness level whether it is lunar-dawn, lunar-noon, or lunar-sunset.

I've looked at the investigation, and all of the questions it raises are easily answered. If you weren't so damn biased, you might have found those answers before coming here and embarrassing yourself :P

""You just ignoring and defending so you make your country greatest in discovering the universe.""

What are you talking about? When the fuck did I say that my country was the greatest at anything? We were the first to put a man on the moon, but that hardly makes us the greatest country, and it certainly doesn't excuse the bad things our government has done. Is that really what this is about? You just hate America, so you choose to believe that our accomplishments just never happened?

Why? You'd obviously just accuse the footage of being fake anyway, would you not?

Face it, dude, all of your arguments have very simple counters. You just don't wanna see that because you have some gripe against America. If you have problems with America, that's fine. I do too. But denying an obvious fact like the lunar landing just makes you look like an idiot.",0

You put the rocks at different elevations? How dumb are you? The shadows appear different because the ground is uneven.

With Japanese it depends how you write the number.  Hiragana, romaji or kanji.  Or katakana, I suppose, but why use those for numbers?  Anyway, with kanji, a longer number in terms of characters within the Arabic numeral system that we use in English won't necessarily increase the number of kanji, or if it does, not by much.  For example, 10000, man, has one character in kanji, 100,000, jiu-man would use two, as would 1000,000, hyaku-man.  But then after 10,000,000, sen-man we reach the next order and a new, singular kanji because the Japanese numbering convention is based around systems of ten thousand.  A more complex number, however, would use more kanji.  10,003, for example, is man-san, which is two kanji.  Then 11,283 would be man-ichi-sen-ni-hyaku-hachi-ji-san.  Which would be seven or eight kanji, depending on if you include ichi (1) in reference to the number of thousnds (sen) or not.  In either case, the number of kanji is lower than ten, so would itself be one kanji, which then loops.  With a complex number of more than ten kanji, it would reduce to either two or three, which reduces to one, which repeats.  Nothing special there; of course one loops in this instance.  With hiragana and katakana, it would function a little differently.  San, meaning three, consists of two characters; sa and n.  Then two is ni, which is one.  Ichi is two; i and chi, so it loops between one and two.  Ten thousand, hyakuman consists of hi(ya), ku, ma and n.  This reduces to four which is either shi or yon; which go to one and two respectively and establish the loop.  Even 11,283 would do this; consisting of 14 or 15 characters, depending on if you count the ya as seperate to the hi in hyaku.  It could also be 12 or 13 if ichi is omitted.  Jiu-ni, jiu-san, jiu-yon and jiu-go consist of 3/4 or 5.  Which enter the ichi-ni-loop.  With romaji it would loop at san or ni.

he is comes to the right result of the equation even tho the way he described it isnt correct (there is a small difference between 10 times 2 apples and 2 times 10 apples...which is irrelevant most of the time)
the reason why he put it this way can be understood when u watch the video a few more seconds (where he steals one ""2"" of of the 10 ""2"" which would not have been possible if he ad just 2 10s standing there)

z134sbjx2xb4ddhe523dz1xzlubydfxwk04,George Wang,7 months ago,1476525578516,"your algorithm for recursive alephs is incorrect.

Because the subscript of every aleph (_) is the main input/variable, that means that it would have to end on the right/bottom-most, and not on the left/top-most script. for it to end on the right would mean that a countably infinite number of steps had to be taken to reach an aleph with a countable subscript (aleph [with no subscript] by itself does not denote any particular infinity), which had to be the input in the first place for the recursive algorithm. the algorithm's construction would have to end in the first place to receive the input, so it wouldn't be endless and thus it couldn't be countably infinite number of infinities.

your algorithm and reasoning reminds me of the colloquial proof for .999... = 1, which is that if you take .9 from .999... and .9 from 1 and multiply both sides by ten, you get .999... = 1. this is incorrect. you cannot take .9 from .999... because subtraction/arithmetic starts from the lowest decimal place, and you cannot get to the lowest decimal place with .999... (.999... doesn't end with a digit that is 9; it doesn't go 999... ...9, that would be an incorrect construction of a number - it doesn't end). 
the rigorous proof is by geometric series, the value of sum(rx10^-n, n to infinity) = 1/(1-r) for r=.9 = 1, but its construction is a countably infinite series of decimal places all equal to nine and it doesn't end, thus .999...

you have to start with a finite input and finite construction, and your algorithm isn't a finite construction.",0,false,0,,,,,,

See, when you know how the economy works, you understand how important immigrants (people) are. Immigrants pay VAT whenever they purchase something. Whenever an immigrant buys food, clothes or a bus ticket, he's paying taxes. Income tax is not what pays public services in most European countries, VAT and other taxes are. If you remove all immigrants in say, a year, the economy would plummet badly and it would be impossible to finance those public services you claim to be stolen by the immigrants.

Also, if they're ""stealing"" your jobs, then they're better workers than you are. Welcome to globalization. Deal with it.",0

What I'm trying to imply is immigration rules are important to ditch out the illegals.

What makes you think that every alien that uses up resources is not contributing by paying taxes like locals? Immigration is not just free entry. It's not like an Australian can just travel to France for a week to get some knee surgery for free. Sure, he can enter the country under certain conditions but, if he wants to stay and leverage public services, chances are he's gonna have to have a contract and an address. If you have those things, then you're already paying taxes and contributing to the system. At that moment, you become a tax payer, regardless of the political border in which the vagina you came out of was located.

If you still distinguish tax payers/contributors by their origin, then you're not against immigration due to economic reasons, you're just a xenophobe.

It turns out that, most developed countries that enjoy greatness nowadays, have based their success on diversity and immigration. The best examples are the USA and most European countries in which a state of welfare is firmly established. We have jobs, we have services and we have lots of contributing immigrants.",0

Keep your vile support for violence away from children. Children can consent perfectly fine. There's nothing about sexual activity that makes it importantly different from all the other things kids are brought to be involved in. Fear conditioning trains children to be traumatized by something that is harmless. The violence and fear conditioning you are a supporter of is the cause of shame and guilt and fear and trauma in children and in the adults they grow into. You are a child abuser and a closed-minded bigot.",0

I learned that formula in one of my engineering classes a couple days ago. It's called Newton's Method. If you want to find the point where two lines intersect you repeatedly use the formula x-(f(x)/f`(x)) until the answer is continuous
Where:
x=Initial guess and subsequent answers
f(x)=Your original formula
f`(x)=The derivative of the formula

If you wanted to find sqrt(16), then you would have y=sqrt(16). However, for the formula to work, your function must be equal to 0. It has to be 0 because the formula is meant to find where the line tangent to the specified point crosses the x-axis. So we get y^2-16=0. So now f(x)=x^2-16. Plugging in these values to the formula we get:
g(x)=x-((x^2-16)/2x)
You can simplify this to get:
g(x)=(x+(16/x))/2
Where 16 is the number you want to find the square root of.

If you plug in any value and then plug the answer into the formula again, the answer will get closer and closer to the value you need. So if we use 3, we'll get the following answers:
g(3)=4.167
g(4.16666666667)=4.003
g(4.00333333333)=4.00000138773
g(4.00000138773)=4
g(4)=4",0,false,0,,,,,,

If you're talking about things like micro-evolution, macro-evolution and all that other bullshit, they don't exist. Evolution is simple change over time.

So the loop ends like this  2 ==> iki ==> 3 ==> √º√ß ==> 2 ==> iki ==> 3 :D",0,false,0,,,,,,

Shrink the manipulated grid so that it fits inside of 1 square. Rotate it 180 degrees so that the top and bottom are swapped. Finally, drag the manipulated grid down to the bottom right corner (grey) and move just the top row of points of the manipulated grid into the pink point.

For clarification, only the bottom right (grey) and the pink point above it have the option to glow since the manipulated grid only occupies space in those points. The grey point on the manipulated grid which would glow on the bottom right point only is located in the pink point and won't glow. The pink point on the manipulated grid which would glow only on the pink point above the bottom right point would be located on the bottom right (grey) because only the top row (originally bottom row containing grey point) of the manipulated grid is located on the pink point. The other 4 rows (containing the pink point) are all located on the bottom right (grey) point. Did I solve it, or have I completely missed something?

Wait, doesn't that mess with thermodynamics? If there is always a point at which the state of the universe is as it was before (i.e. in a certain energy state), doesn't that mean that there can never be maximum entropy in a closed system? Because there must always be a point that remains in it's original state.

Speaking of that, we can say that time is a continuous transformation of the universe, and (assuming it is a closed system), everything stays in the same 'space', so the fixed point theorem must apply. That means the universe can never truly achieve maximum entropy, right?

You do know that both expressions are equivalent, right?
Whether you say that 25 represents 2*10+1*5 or 10*2+5*1 does not matter. The inherent commutative property makes the distinction trivial. It is also not a matter of formal accuracy, as both are equally accurate descriptions of the number. The fact that we use base 10 does not matter. It also would not matter in binary, or base 2. They share the same basic mathematical axioms.

Your incompetence to understand that the distinction is trivial is neither my fault, nor an actual issue of any sorts. It is merely you not overcoming mental barriers that only you uphold for yourself.",1

There are no other ""valid positions"", only retarded opinions.

In ANY base number system (B) every digit has a very specific meaning. A digit in the nth position (from left to right) indicates ALWAYS how many times the quantity B^(n-1) needs to be added in order to arrive at the number that the digits represent.

There's no debate, no democracy about it.

No, you are wrong.  25 can mean either 2 tens and 5 units OR it can mean ten lots of 2 and one lot of 5.  Either interpretation works.  If you think I'm retarded, then I challenge you to find a counterexample where it doesn't work, or prove that yours is the only correct interpretation.",0

The only process of retardation I am able to find in this¬† discussion is you backpaddeling from the position of understanding the commutative property of our number system only to insist that said property does not exist and that the order of multiplication is relevant.

It is equivalent to write (using your proposed writing scheme) B^(n-1)*k, whereas k is the number in the n-th position, or to write k*B^(n-1). I also agree with the notion of +letao12 to show formal proof or any counterproof in which your interpretation is right and other positions wrong, though I do not think anyone would be able to produce said proof. Alternatively, citation of peer-reviewed or universally accepted papers on the matter are also a valid defense for your stance.
Further, to only shout ""wrong!"" at other positions is not a valid defense for your position. Disagreement alone cannot defend itself.",0

That doesn't prove anything.  You're just saying the same wrong thing again.  Repeating the same thing over and over doesn't make it true.

25 in base 10 can just as well mean take the digit 2 TEN times and the digit 5 ONE time.

Again I ask that you either find a counterexample where my interpretation doesn't work, or provide proof that yours is the only valid interpretation.",1

I agree again with +letao12. Unless you provide ample proof why our interpretation is wrong, you are simply repeating the same statement, which doesn't change your lack of reasoning or arguments for it.
I also think that we have made it abundantly clear why our interpretation should be valid, and the only way to argue against it, is to provide counterarguments, as is natural within a discussion. All else is simply irrelevant at this point.",0

You wrote your first point, realized you had a second, and wrote ""Second of all,"" but then had to go back and add ""First of all,"" failing to fix your capitalization.

Now if you're going to tell people to look up ad hominem, you should make sure you know what it is.  Attacking the word choice in your comment about word choice isn't committing ad hominem.  I'm not even sure in what sense you thought it was ad hominem; maybe it was the first grade quip.  Either way, the stench of your charred remains is making me sick.

and you have to think that no matter how intelligent he is, he isnt just winging it with the dialogue. he most likely scripts his videos carefully, making sure the facts are right. it might take him more than a couple drafts, carefully deciding where to introduce ideas and how to present them in an easy-to-understand way. and he isnt a one take machine either, no one is. he again most likely does multiple takes for the video and multiple takes of narration to get it right.
then comes editing, which may not take more than a couple hours, but still... thats hours out of his day.
im not saying it takes a lot of work... but it doesnt take no work man. shit takes time. he makes high quality videos. and i guess if he wanted to he could make videos once a week, but... i'd guess the quality would drop. because it seems like, to me, he makes a video when he finds an interesting topic to talk about. doesnt seem like he forces the search for interesting topics, and if he did, his videos would suffer for it.
i dont know what point im making by now. i guess what im saying is that its not as simple as ""videos are easy to make why doesnt he make more"", or at least i dont see it that way. hope reading this wasnt a waste of time for you Malicious haha and that it was worth something.",0

The only reason it works on earth is because of the continuous rate of change of temperature along the surface or within the boundaries of molecules interacting with each other. But in the universe there are parts where both temperature and pressure drop or increase erratically (in fact planets are some of these things/points). But then if you want to be technical, within a given piece of space there are ""substances"" and well even things popping in and out of existence, I won't get into it, but basically there's likely to be some temperature reading at a certain spot, but this would mean that the only way to match temperature and pressure ever is to go along paths without matter.

It works on things that are within a closed system and they need to be able to shift throughout that entire system that you're measuring. Temperature and the likes don't have effect on the vaccuum around the atmosphere, at least not in the same way pressure or temperature influence the atmosphere on earth. The objects size doesn't matter, but there's a lot more variables to an entire earth than constant motions. If you wanted to measure something in the Universe (radiation, dark matter, anything that can constantly move through space), you'd still have those cutting points, and one place in the universe where all those readings are the same as on earth, but that doesn't mean that all the other variables that have been created within our own closed system (earth) will be the same.",2

In Calculus you'll learn what a continuous function is and how the Intermediate Value Theorem explains this phenomenon. Unlike temperature on the Earth, the distribution of mass/energy in space is not continuous, as you can have a large amount (say, 100) of mass at one point and a small amount of mass at a point directly next to it (say, 5), without needing to pass through every value between 100 and 5 as you move between the points. The only way for there to assuredly be an identical Earth planet in the universe is for the universe to be infinite, which is countered by the limit of the speed of light and therefore the size of the observable universe.",0

Temperature is the average thermal energy of the molecules in a region. You can think about gravity or material density in the same way. E.g. if you define material density at any point as the number of nuclei in a small sphere around that point divided by the volume of the sphere, then you will have a continuous function within the resolution of ""one nucleus"".

If you take two points in space and any two distinct curves between those points (that would be the two half circles connecting the two antipodes in the earth example), then any continuous function must have two points (one on each curve) with equal value even under an additional location constraint (e.g. the points also must be antipodes). If does work everywhere. On the earth surface, inside the volume of a room, in space, everywhere. It only has to be a finite space.

The problem with ""there MUST be another earth somewhere"" is about dimensions. The earth surface is (in the simplified model) two dimensional. That is why you can get two continuous functions to match. If you take 3d space, you could expand that to (any) three continuous functions which will have a pair of points in space (with an additional positional constraint) where all 3 values are the same on both points. The ""earth"" is defined by bazillions of atoms in specific configurations. That is more than 3 scalar values can describe. So no second earth for you.",0

I never said anything against the existence of dark matter nor the particle, I only pointed to an anomaly that counterattacks the possibilities of the theorem holding true for the whole universe. You didn't even explain anything really, you just babbled about dark matter, and reiterated a few things I said in different ways. 

I was pointing to the necessity of continuous entropy in a closed system for this to work, not just interaction. Not only is there many other ways that this just isn't a proof, and I only specified one using the actual theorem because I didn't want to seem like I was just against the hypothesis you made, but, as you can see how everyone has explained, the theorem isn't going to prove another earth. Apart from the premise that that's simply not what the theorem would do even if it proved successful, there's just way too many other things that break the hypothesis down. In case of success, a point between two other points match up in temperature and pressure, but that point isn't pre-determined, so that would just lead to one bit of space matching attributes of one other bit of space, and maybe just possibly another bit of matter matching the environmental attributes of another bit of matter, but not a whole specified planet. This is all assuming you can even look at the universe with the same perspective as a Planet. The best way to prove another earth is just probability like I was pointing to before.

Thank you to everyone else, it seems the proof police were out on this one, mathematics division, physics division and all.",0

Which means you're right over +KohuGaly, but this would have to be a complete hole all the way to the bottom of the cup to work. 

Still skeptical? Think about a snapshot of the swirling drink from above, and you can imagine seeing a small indent, which means there are some points that are drastically moved apart, but imagine looking at the cup from the side and outlining the parts where the liquid would be.. It would still be occupying a good bit of space completely regardless of the intent atop. Now imagine you swirled so hard that there's a hole all the way down to the bottom, you know this is a hole from a bird-eye point of view, but now looking at it from the side, imagining that you could move forward looking through the (vertical) layers of the liquid from the side. At some point you would see two separate outlines depicting the liquid, and since they are separated this would indicate a cut through the liquid. 

Tldr look at vsauce's cup figure/picture 3:02, a spin hard enough to create a hole would look exactly the same. I don't think it works that well with 3d objects, but vsauce was betting that no matter what it would be easy to say it works because the hole in 3d is the same as his hole in 2d, just also able to be seen in another perspective as what it really is (a cut) and the different horizontal layers work just like 2d. He was really betting on the middle staying the same in parts furthest away from the transformation (the stirring), which would start from the top and have less effect at the bottom of the cup.",2

It's a lot weirder than the 2d explanation because the transformation is caused by physics like centripetal force and cohesion of the liquid as well as just the way liquid takes shape of it's container, which means it's very much like the 2D visualization, but also just capable of a lot more. But even theoretically that hole would bypass the theorem because of the possibility of displacement. 

+RStarbuck13‚Äã nice bro, technically there's still a chance that a molecule still ends up in the same place, but that's almost random chance and since the theorem holds that there will be a spot that matches and the hole makes that impossible to prove. Cool thing is that the inside wall of liquid still holds the middle molecule, which means that when you stop spinning and the liquid starts displacing back to the middle, there's a chance that the middle molecule falls back into place (it's just that possibility is also true for at least a few other molecules around the part, which negates the theorem), depending on how large the part is at that (horizontal) ""layer"".",1

All of them are really great channels. Just found out about CaptainDisillusion yesterday and binchwatched all the videos. Harry Partridge does amazing animation work and kurzgesagt got allot of neat and interesting knowledge presented in a cool way.

I'll try to explain it but it's hard with text and it would be easier if you could see it so I recommend using any program where you can paste images then move / rotate them (and optionally make them slightly transparent). First image the squares are named A-E from left to right and 1-5 from top to bottom. I first rotated¬†a second copied¬†image 180 degrees and made it small enough so the whole thing could fit inside one square from the other image. I then put the full shape inside box E2 which is yellow except the left most column which contained the same yellow same which I position so it was outside of box E2 and inside box D2. I hope this is clear enough for others to recreate my findings as I don't have a good way to post an image.

If the coffee is a cylinder, it's convex, is it compact though? Thats where the mathematics and reality separate. The fixed point 'lines' I just mentioned are right on the boundry. If the 'set' (all points of coffee) includes those points on the boundry then yes it works. But we can make it not work by saying those points on the boundry are not part of the coffee, in which case it obviously does not work, but importantly it stoped working because the cylinder without its boundry points is not compact, so it's still perfectly consistent with the rule!",0

Banach's fixed point theorem states that any continuous mapping that makes distances between points smaller (more precisely, there is some positive number less than one such that the distance between any two mapped points is at most that number times the distance between the original points) has exactly one fixed point. This does not require boundedness or no holes, just a nonempty complete metric space.

Exactly. Someone who grew up speaking a language with all of that stuff won't understand how the fuck English works, because there's no patterns. Plural of box is boxes, but the plural of ox is oxen, for example.

Patterns that very rarely hold true. Plural of house is houses, plural of mouse is mice. Plural of man is men, plural of pan is pans. Apostrophes seem to just be thrown where ever the fuck you feel like. Gender pronouns (male = him, female =/= shim, and so on) have very little in common in English, whereas in most other languages, the only difference is the last letter of the word.

English has too many exceptions to each ""pattern"" for them to really be called patterns, especially compared to just about every other language. Most people not born into an English speaking household agree that English is a very hard language to learn. Even people that were born into English speaking homes don't speak very good English.",0

These fractals are described by a set of transformations leading to a fixed point, which is the fractal itself. This has been used in fractal image compression since we keep only small number of transformations and can use any starting image at any resolution and always end up with the target (decoded) image after few iterations.

The JPEG lossy image compression, for example, is designed to be idempotent, hence if you recompress an already compressed image (with same quality settings), no information is loss, the quality will stay the same.

Image descriptors in computer vision are often designed to be invariant to various geometric transformations, hence images can be matched and aligned to each other regardless on how they are moved, rotated or zoomed.",0,false,0,,,,,,

In my oribtial mechanics class we went over inertial frames of reference that of course allow us to setup coordinate planes to orient spacecract and such. Well, it was concluded in class that every point in the space moves and so when we choose Earth Centered Inertial or any other coordonate system, the point we choose still moves. With respect to your video showing the reality of fixed points, why have we not been able to find a point (an origin) at which we can refer to always and use as a coordinate plane for everything in need of one ve it space or not but, you know, so that it's standardized?",1,true,4,,,,,,

In an inertial frame, the coordinate points don't move. Inertial things have a constant velocity wrt an inertial coordinate system, that velocity can be zero, and for any inertial thing you can pick a frame where it's velocity is whatever you like, 0 or otherwise. 

Fixed points are a concept from an area of mathematics called Topology. The idea is that if you take a set with certain properties and make a function that takes points from the set to other points in the set with certain properties, there will always be a point that gets mapped to itself. Exactly which point depends on the function, it does not mean any function will have the same fixed point as any other.

Usually when you model space as a 4d coordinate system (space + time), you assume it is infinitely big, and let's say you are ignoring special relativity and use galilean relativity (velocities are much smaller than the speed of light! and space is euclidean!) The fixed point theorem he mentioned in the video only works for 'compact' sets, and in normal settings the enitre infinte 3d euclidean space is not compact (it's not bounded) so there's nothing to say a map (like a gallilean change of coordinates) has a fixed point.",1

Example: if a spacecraft accelerates at one g (9.85 meters per second squared) after two hours it will reach a speed of 250,000 kilometers per hour at a distance of 250,000 kilometers. This ratio holds true whatever the acceleration rate is. At 10 g (98.5 meters per second squared) after two hours the ship is traveling at 2.5 million kph at a distance of 2.5 million kms.

You're supposed to maintain vicinities - points separated by a distance that goes to zero stay that way after the transformation.

I think then non would be touching its original point, could be wrong tho. It would help if there was some sort of interactive version. But here is my example: http://puu.sh/rqVtD/bf184d35f1.jpg Basically if you were to move the lower right square so that the two grey boxes were diagonal from each other assuming they are not touching.

And I thought about if this could apply to real life, and it does. If you press the elevator call button right before if coincidentally reaches the floor you just called it to that would be a critical action. Or if you were cutting a watermelon and you go clean through with no resistance, that is a critical action. And like in a game you can force some criticals to happen, like if you kiccked a ball right dead in the center it will receive the most energy and fly the straightest, or if you hit the cue ball in billiards and knock all the other balls into the pockets, or sing a note at just the right frequency to break a glass. This fact changes nothing, and it is unlikely that you will every critical at amazon and you next shipment will be free, but I think it's interesting that you can be so lucky or skilled to have a critically successful action",0,false,0,,,,,,

Ok, first of all, cuatro (four in spanish) has 6 letters, seis (six in spanish) has 4 letters. So we just have started an endless cicle with the english mistical number. We can get stuck in the same cicle with the number ocho (8), because it also has cuatro letters, and cuatro has seis letters and so on. The same with tres (3), and with uno (1, and uno has 3 letters), and with dos (2, the same as one), and others.

Let's try a different number, 7: siete has five letters and cinco (5) has 5 letters also. Nueve (9) also has 5 numbers, so right now we know that in sanish there can be two different cicles.

Let's try a bigger number: 1 000 000, un millon has 8 letters, and then it is in the first cicle. Dos millones (2 000 000) has eleven letters, and once (11) has also four letters, so it fits in the first cicle. Let's pick something more random, let's say dos mil setecientos ochenta y cuatro (2 784)and it has 31 letters,  and treinta y uno has 11 letters... also fits in the first one.

Then, looks like even when in spanish there is a number with the same amount of letters than the amount it represents looks like there is another cicle that has more elements to fit in, y eso siempre. Gracias por leer ; )",1,false,0,,,,,,

1) It has to stay in ‚Ñï_0: it starts in ‚Ñï by definition, and the most you can subtract from n is n, if and only if it is a one-digit number. Then it hits 0, and it is fixed there.
2) It always decreases, because you're subtracting a positive quantity from a positive quantity.
 We can infer that, repeating the process long enough, every natural number n will reach 0
3) Every number that you get in the process has to be a multiple of 9 in each step but the first one
 To sum it up:
If it's more-than-one-digited, it won't hit 0 straightaway, but it will eventually. You have to pass from a one-digit number. That number has to be 9, because it's the only one-digited number that is multiple of 9. 
So every natural number has to get to 0 and has to get there passing from 9",0,false,0,,,,,,

if you were to be able to look at thee infinite number, and not the symbol of it, it would be a constantly moving number right? 

there's bigger compression of the same concept of infinity, and different pattern on course to infinity... making them different infinities because they have so much room foreword, that they wouldn't foreseeable go back to fill in any gaps in the pattern to be a more complete infinity, unless wit was written out in tons of different directions (like an octopus), which the numerical language doesn't do.

For starters, infinity isn't 'moving' anywhere - like I kinda get what you mean by that but I don't agree. Are you saying that you can define a fundamental difference between infinitely many numbers arranged on a line and infinitely many numbers arranged in all directions like a grid, and so they're in a sense different types of infinite?

You mention gaps a lot too - do you mean gaps between the numbers in the infinite set being considered?",0

infinity is constantly in progress, so how could it not be moving. you know it as a possibility and identify it by symbol, but never see it; because It's always on the run.

by ""gap"", i meant the space between the numerical pattern. there's infinite infinities there too, in fraction. I'm talking about different directions of counting within the infinity that it's in.

by direction, i mean to think outside of the way math is written. I guess it would make any space between anything, inside of infinity, a variable. Even a whole number could then be considered a whole new pattern of constants, if there's an algorithm placed on the numbers in infinite count.

infinity in a straight line can be just is, maybe, if the question is never ""when?""

Because the information that we could ever know about any given infinity, is never over except foe when we know its trajectory.
I'm suggesting the possibility that the counting systems split into different directions of infinity, which would imply course that isn't ""is"", because much of it hasn't happened yet and variable change takes place, like algorithm of space density..

... like infinity with it's own RNA instructions. You can't read it all, if those instructions are infinitely changing patterns, while dealing with variable changes.

Now, let's think about integers ( ... , -2,  -1 , 0 , 1, 2, ...). This also contains an infinite amount of numbers, however, it includes other numbers that the prior two sets do not contain. 

How about real numbers? Those include ALL numbers from negative infinity to positive infinity, not JUST integers. This is also an infinite set, and includes more numbers that all the other sets I've mentioned.

z135yzsydy2ky3tlw23vc1rgfoicvd1mq,Skyrone Dyrone,7 months ago,1476525985746,"Awwwww... although your description of the number 25 is mathematically equivalent.  It isn't how it is in a base-10 numbering system.  The first digit to the left of the decimal point is the number of times that you have 10 to the zero-th power (or ones).  The second position is the number of times you have ten to the first power (or tens).  The third position is the number of times you have ten to the second (or hundreds)... and so forth.  Each place is one power of ten larger than the previous that is closer to the decimal point. All of this is obvious as we all just know.

Thus 25 is more accurately 2 times 10 to the first power (10+10) plus 5 times 10 to the zero-th power (the zero'-th power of any base number 2 or greater is always 1... so 5 times the zero-th power of 10 is equal to 5).

Mathematically 2 ten times is the same as 10 two times. But, when trying to explain the number we know as 25, it is best to use the poper way that expresses the digits of the number in its base number notation.

A complicated subject as Fixed Points mixed in with this kind of under sight, to me, dilutes the discussion and validity for me to a consider the concept of Fixed Points.  To me, if one of the foundation building blocks of a concept is fundamentally wrong, I can't proceed with what is proposed farther down the line.

However, I must say that I believe you have reached a point with your videos where you seem to be moving away from what made your channel so great to begin with. I love math stuff just as much as the next Vsauce subscriber, but you seem to be putting out a disproportionate number of videos about obscure math concepts lately that, in all honesty, are not really that interesting. Now, I'm sure that there are people reading this who would totally disagree with what I just said, but I would venture to guess that those individuals make up less than a quarter of your subscribers. All I'm asking is that you return to asking questions that are outside of the realm of normal everyday thinking, and answer them in the factual, entertaining, and truly unique way that only you can.

Second Question
If the same black hole attracts two bodies,

you have to enter in a room but you don't know the password so you wait and spy on others entering.

The number of ways you can make a subset of a set, will always be strictly larger than the number of elements in the set. Pick any infinity, and let's call it A. Then consider the number of ways you could make a subset of a set of A elements. That number will be strictly larger than A.

Specifically, you can make 2^n different subsets from a set with n elements. For any cardinal w, infinite or not, it holds that w < 2^w. For example, it even holds for 0:
